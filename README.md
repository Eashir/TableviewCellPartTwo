## TableviewCellPartTwo

<br>

Lets keep our Second Horizontal Stackview with the time labels. We'll set its `Alignment` to Center and its `Distribution` to Equal Spacing. `Spacing` will be 36 

We'll begin with our ProfileImageView. 

1. Set it to 40 width and 40 height.
2. Give it a top space and trailing constraint of 16
3. We can also provide it with an aspect ratio of 1:1


1. Add a textlabel with font size 20
2. Set its `height` to >= 20
3. Set its leading constraint as 16 to the ProfileImageView
4. Hold control and drag from the label to the ProfileImageView to set its **Align Top** constraint

1. Lets make a copy of this label with font size 14
2. Align its leading to the Name label
3. Set its trailing space to the superview to 189
4. Make a view
5. Change the color black or your preferred line separator color
6. Set its height to 1
