## TableviewCellPartTwo

<br>

Lets keep our Second Horizontal Stackview with the time labels. We'll set its `Alignment` to Center and its `Distribution` to Equal Spacing. `Spacing` will be 36 

We'll begin with our ProfileImageView. 

1. Set it to 40 width and 40 height.
2. Give it a top space and trailing constraint of 16
3. We can also provide it with an aspect ratio of 1:1


1. Add a textlabel
2. Set its `height` to >= 20
3. Set its leading constraint as 16 to the ProfileImageView
